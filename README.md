# improved_model

If someone wants to view the results I got from the dataset that I used while making the model all they would have to do is download all csv data file and notebook file. They would have to put notebook file and csv file in same folder and add run the notebook file. If someone wants to run model on their persoal data all they would have to do is upload data into same folder as the notebook file. After uploading files to folder you would have to change the code in second cell so the pd.read() funciton is reading in your data. Then you have to put the dataframes into their respective lists at bottom at cell so training data can later know which one is browsing data vs streaiming data.
